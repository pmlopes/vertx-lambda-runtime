/**
 * Your Lambda function's handler is the method that Lambda calls when your function is invoked.
 *
 * In the following example, the class MyFunction implements a lambda handler. The handler takes
 * one object as input and returns a JSON document.
 *
 * <code>
 *     (msg) -&gt; {
 *         System.out.println(msg.body());
 *         msg.reply(new JsonObject().put("hello", "world"));
 *     }
 * </code>
 *
 * The message body is an object that contains the payload that's provided by the invoker. If the payload is a JSON
 * document, the event object is a {@link JsonObject}. Otherwise, it's a {@link Buffer}. The {@link Message} object has
 * methods and properties that provide information about the invocation, the headers, and the execution environment.
 *
 * The handler is executed every time your Lambda function is invoked. Static code outside of the handler or the
 * {@link Lambda#init(Vertx)} method is executed once per instance of the function. If your handler uses resources like
 * SDK clients and database connections, you can create them outside of the handler method to reuse them for multiple
 * invocations.
 *
 * Each instance of your lambda can process multiple invocation events, but it only processes one event at a time.
 * The number of instances processing an event at any given time is your function's concurrency. For more information
 * about the Lambda execution context, see AWS Lambda Execution Context.
